1. closed eyes not detected
2. need to check region of interest rectangle sizes - the ROIs shouldn't vary too much in subsequent frames, gregor suggested calculating
moving averages for rectangle sizes
3. check usage of kalman flter for face tracking - this should improve cases where faces are undetected
4. may be there is a better way to get the positions of face, mouth and nose ROIs
5. need to check how to detect tilted faces
6. also need to tag marker coords, outside face ROI: outside face, inside face but not on any feature, marker not found. Also need to tag a frame with 
face not found.
